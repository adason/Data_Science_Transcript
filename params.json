{"name":"Data Science Transcript","tagline":"You-Cyuan Jhang","body":"Background\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIn my Ph.D career, I have been working on the [numerical simulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_QCD) of [quantum chromodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics), which studies the behavior of [quarks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [gluons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) under strong the [strong interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction). Research in this area usually involves creating programs that will run on 1000+ cores clusters, waiting for weeks or longer before one can extract meaningful physical parameters to compare with experimental results. This makes me comfortable with C/C++ programming in Linux/Unix distributed systems, scripting in Ruby to provide enough automation, as well as simple statistics and visualization in R to produce static reports.\r\n\r\nHowever, my academic track didn't provide me with enough theoretical and technical knowledge as a data scientists. To think like a data scientist, one needs to have solid understanding of statistics and machine learning algorithms, as well as database / big data systems. Fortunately, the [MOOCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course), e-books and online blogs can provide valuable and free resources for self-learner. Inspired from the [open-source data science masters](http://datasciencemasters.org), I started to learn and sharpen these data science skills. Related projects and \"course\" achievements will be summarized in this \"transcript\". \r\n\r\nProjects\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Kaggle Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge\r\n    - Used regularized regressions and neural networks on customer's quote histories to perform structured predictions of their final purchases.\r\n    - Ranked 315/1570 on public leader-board, less than 1% score difference form the first rank.\r\n\r\n- Weight Lifting Exercise Machine Learning Prediction\r\n    - Performed exercise pattern recognition from accelerometer and gyroscope time-series data.\r\n    - Applied principle component analysis to reduce sensor correlations. Built prediction models using bagged / boosted decision trees to yield a comparable accuracy.\r\n\r\n- Severe Weather Events Analysis\r\n    - Analyzed economic damages caused by severe weather events in the United State from 1950 to 2011.\r\n    - Utilized regular expressions to parse 1000+ different weather event names, aggregated the damages and grouped into different states. Applied data manipulation libraries in R to process the raw data.\r\n\r\nData Science Path\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n### Math\r\n\r\n- Mathematical Statistics -- [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/engv4/index.html) | [Book](http://books.google.com/books?id=i-cTAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:ISBN0495110817)\r\n- Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Group Theory -- [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/engv4/index.html) | [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml)\r\n- Statistical Inference -- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Statistical_Inference.pdf)\r\n- Regression Models -- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/course/regmods) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Regression_Models.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning\r\n\r\n- Statistical Learning -- [Stanford / OpenEdx](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Statistical_Learning.pdf)\r\n- An Introduction to Statistical Learning -- [Book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)\r\n- The Elements of Statistical Learning (Reference) -- [Book](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)\r\n\r\n### Algorithm\r\n\r\n- Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 -- [Stanford / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Algorithms__Design_and_Analysis_Part1.pdf)\r\n- Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2 -- [Stanford / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) | in progress\r\n\r\n### Database / Big Data\r\n\r\n- Introduction to Databases -- [Stanford / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) | in progress\r\n- Introduction to Data Science -- [UW / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) | in progress\r\n    - SQL, MapReduce/Hadoop/Pig\r\n- Mining of Massive Data Sets (Chapter 2) -- [Book](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html)\r\n\r\n### R\r\n\r\n- R Programming -- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/R_Programming.pdf)\r\n- Getting and Cleaning Data -- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Getting_and_Cleaning_Data.pdf)\r\n- Exploratory Data Analysis -- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/course/exdata) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.pdf)\r\n- Reproducible Research -- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Reproducible_Research.pdf)\r\n- Developing Data Products -- [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) | [Certification](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4109265/Certifications/Developing_Data_Products.pdf)\r\n- Applied Predictive Modeling -- [Book](http://books.google.com/books/about/Applied_Predictive_Modeling.html?id=xYRDAAAAQBAJ)\r\n- Libraries: [caret](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html), [data.table](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html), [ggplot2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), [neuralnet](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neuralnet/index.html), [glmnet](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html), [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Python\r\n\r\n- Twitter Sentiment Analysis -- [Sample Code / Github](https://github.com/adason/datasci_course_materials/tree/master/assignment1)\r\n- Collections of Graph Algorithms -- [Sample Code / Github](https://github.com/adason/graph_algo)\r\n","google":"UA-53649611-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
