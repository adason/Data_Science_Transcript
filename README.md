Background
----------

In my Ph.D career, I have been working on the [numerical simulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_QCD) of [quantum chromodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics), which studies the behavior of [quarks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [gluons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) under strong the [strong interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction). Research in this area usually involves creating programs that will run on 1000+ cores clusters, waiting for weeks or longer before one can extract meaningful physical parameters to compare with experimental results. This makes me comfortable with C/C++ programming in Linux/Unix distributed systems, scripting in Ruby to provide enough automation, as well as simple statistics and visualization in R to produce static reports.

However, my academic track didn't provide me with enough theoretical and technical knowledge as a data scientists. To think like a data scientist, one needs to have solid understanding of statistics and machine learning algorithms, as well as database / big data systems. Fortunately, the [MOOCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course), e-books and online blogs can provide valuable and free resources for self-learner. Inspired from the [open-source data science masters](http://datasciencemasters.org), I started to learn and sharpen these data science skills. Related projects and "course" achievements will be summarized in this "transcript". 

Projects
--------

- Kaggle Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge
    - Used regularized regressions and neural networks on customer's quote histories to perform structured predictions of their final purchases.
    - Ranked 315/1570 on public leader-board, less than 1% score difference from the first rank.

- Weight Lifting Exercise Machine Learning Prediction
    - Performed exercise pattern recognition from accelerometer and gyroscope time-series data.
    - Applied principal component analysis to reduce sensor correlations. Built prediction models using bagged / boosted decision trees to yield a comparable accuracy.

- Severe Weather Events Analysis
    - Analyzed economic damages caused by severe weather events in the United State from 1950 to 2011.
    - Utilized regular expressions to parse 1000+ different weather event names, aggregated the damages and grouped into different states. Applied data manipulation libraries in R to process the raw data.
